This project analyzes a relational e-commerce dataset to extract meaningful business insights related to customers, orders, and sales. It combines SQL-based querying with Python-based visualization to support data-driven decision-making.

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw e-commerce data
- Use SQL to extract actionable insights (orders, sales, customers)
- Visualize key performance indicators using Python

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQL (via SQLite / PostgreSQL / MySQL)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Highlights

- Built a data pipeline to clean and join customer, orders, and product datasets.
- Executed complex SQL queries to extract insights like:
  - Top customers and their purchasing patterns
  - Order frequency and revenue trends
  - Product performance and category-wise sales
- Visualized trends and summaries using Python to support:
  - Strategic planning
  - Customer segmentation
  - Marketing campaigns

- Customer LTV (lifetime value) and high-value segments
- Seasonal trends in product sales
- Average order value and basket size analysis
